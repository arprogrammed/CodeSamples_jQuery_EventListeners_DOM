# Code Showcase 2

This repo is for displaying the things I have learned to code and concepts grasped for coding in Javascript using the Document Object Model, the jQuery framework, and use of event listners. Each file will contain comments that explain the code I used and my thinking behind it.

### DrumKit

This code uses Javascript with event listeners to create an interactive Drum Kit to play with for sound. *Uses JS, event listeners, accessing the document object model, and switch logic. Also HTML, CSS, and Google Fonts.*

**Desired output:** A rendered and interactive webpage with several drums that the user can click on to hear their sounds played. Optionally the user can use keyboard keys to produce the same results as clicking.

### jQueryExample

This small snippet was just a basic test built to produce a reaction with the user and webpage. *Uses jQuery, JS, HTML, CSS.*

**Desired output:** A rendered and interactive webpage accessed through the jQuery framework.

### SimonGame

This game is launched in a browser to create a randomized Simon Says style of gaming. *Uses jQuery, JS, HTML, CSS, event listeners, functions, and logic.*

**Desired output:** A rendered and interactive webpage that allows the user to play a game where the first color is chosen, then the user imitates the color pattern until they fail to remember the entire pattern.

#### Markdown, Git CLI, and Github

This document also displays a basic understanding of Markdown. Additionally the repo was create on Github, but the versioning and remote push were all executed from the CMD line with Git.
